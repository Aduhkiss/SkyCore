# Infinity Games - SkyCore

Hello there everyone! This is the public GitHub repository for the SkyCore project, owned by Infinity Games.

## What is this?

Like I said in the introduction, this is a public repo for the SkyCore project, which is a plugin that we run on our Infinity Sky server, which contains most of the custom aspects of the server.

## Why is it public?

We have open sourced this code, with the core purpose to allow the community to contribute their work into the games code and to help make the server better!

### A copy of this code is hosted on our Minecraft: Java Edition server which can be accessed at play.infinitysky.dx.am
